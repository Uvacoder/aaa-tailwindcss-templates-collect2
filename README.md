# FairPrice Website & App

A simple practice project for playing around with Tailwind in a proper PostCSS environment.

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iamsahilvhora/fair-price.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run serve
    ```

    Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

4. Open `public/index.html` in your editor and start experimenting!

## Building for production

```bash
# Using npm
npm run production
```

After that's done, check out `./public/build/tailwind.css` to see the optimized output.
